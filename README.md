üè• Hospital Readmission Prediction
=================================

This project uses machine learning to predict patient hospital readmissions based on clinical and demographic data.  
The goal is to help healthcare providers identify at-risk patients, reduce readmission rates, and improve patient outcomes.  

--------------------------------
Project Workflow
--------------------------------
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Understand feature distributions and correlations
   - Identify outliers and missing values
   - Visualize readmission trends

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical features
   - Address class imbalance using SMOTE
   - Feature selection / removal of redundant columns

3. Modeling:
   - Train baseline model (Random Forest Classifier)
   - Compare with Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM
   - Apply class balancing techniques

4. Evaluation:
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix (analyzing False Positives & False Negatives)
   - ROC-AUC Curve
   - Precision-Recall Curve
   - Threshold tuning for optimal trade-off

--------------------------------
Results
--------------------------------
- Random Forest achieved good predictive performance after handling imbalance.
- Important predictors included number of procedures, time in hospital, and certain lab test results.
- Threshold tuning reduced false negatives, improving patient safety insights.

--------------------------------
Technologies Used
--------------------------------
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn
- XGBoost, LightGBM

--------------------------------
How to Run
--------------------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/HospitalReadmission_Prediction.git
   cd HospitalReadmission_Prediction

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate the model.

--------------------------------
Future Improvements
--------------------------------
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)
- Integration with real-time hospital data
- Deployment as a web app for healthcare providers
- Experiment with deep learning models

--------------------------------
Note
--------------------------------
This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates how machine learning can be applied in healthcare to reduce hospital readmission rates.
